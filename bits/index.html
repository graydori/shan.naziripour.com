              It's interesting how quickly we can feel like nothing. Our
              headspace can change in an instant, and a challenge looms like a
              massive obstacle.

              But the beautiful part of humans is when we rise to that challenge

              though somehow the answer has always been there right in front of

              Dating is exhausting sometimes. So when you are tired, take a
              break and keep going. You'll find it because it will constantly be
              changing. And remember, you're never lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              You're right where you were supposed to be, even if that's not
              where you were hoping to be.

              I love the phrases with a double meaning. To lose one's marble is
              to lose one's mind. What part of your mind does the marble
              represent? Your thoughts? Part of your identity?

              It's a curious conundrum, but the more I think about it the more
              mad I get.

              I love the phrases with a double meaning. "Its nuts" is such a

              I've struggled with IBS for most of my life. It's manageable, but
              I get flare-ups every once in a while. I wish my body would be
              okay; still, I'm constantly monitoring what I eat and how it makes
              me feel. And some things like nuts can flare things up.
